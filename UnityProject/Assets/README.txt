Hello, This is what im calling the advanced inventory system.
Basically what you will stumble upon in this package is alot
of commenting on how things are done. This is more of a
how-to guide then anything else, and can be used for whatever
you like!!!!

Enjoy.


If you find any bugs or problems, Or simply are looking
for some help with this you may drop me a line at
