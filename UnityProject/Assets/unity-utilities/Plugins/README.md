# Plugins

These are [extension methods][extension-methods] that do various utility tasks
around Unity.

## Using it

To use any of these, just add it to your project, then add the following line
to the top of your C# code:

```cs
using ExtensionMethods;
```

And then you can call these new methods on any `LayerMask`, `GameObject`,
`NetworkView`, etc.

I recommend checking out the source if you want to tweak - it should hopefully
be readable and well-commented.

## Problems

If you have any problems, feel free to contact me at jorgenpt@gmail.com. If you
find any bugs, please report them on the [issue tracker][issues].
